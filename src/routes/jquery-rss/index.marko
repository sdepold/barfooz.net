        Feedr is a service for parsing RSS and Atom feeds. You just pass the URL of an
        RSS/Atom feed and the service will return the parsed feed as JSON. Feedr was originally
        designed as a drop-in replacement for Google's Feed API, which has been deprecated and
        taken offline on December 15th, 2016.
