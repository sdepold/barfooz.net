      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Feedr is a service for parsing RSS and Atom feeds. You just pass the URL of an
        RSS/Atom feed and the service will return the parsed feed as JSON. Feedr was originally
        designed as a drop-in replacement for Google's Feed API, which has been deprecated and
        taken offline on December 15th, 2016.

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Feedr has to be requested with the query parameterqthat contains the URL of the to-be-parsed
        RSS/Atom feed. An example request looks like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        curl 'http://www.feedrapp.info/?q=http://www.ebaytechblog.com/feed/'
      </code>
      <p>The result will look like this (please note that the output is slightly truncated):</p>

Evaluating the quality of these algorithms is usually done using human judgment. For example, if an algorithm claims to detect whether an image contains a pet, the claim can be checked by selecting a sample of images, using human judges to detect if there is a pet, and then comparing this to the results to the algorithm. This post discusses a pitfall in using human judgment that has been mostly overlooked until now.\nIn real life, human judges are imperfect. This is especially true if the judges are crowdsourced. This is not a new observation. Many proposals to process raw judgment scores and improve their accuracy have been made. They almost always involve having multiple judges score each item and combining the scores in some fashion. The simplest (and probably most common) method of combination is majority vote: for example, if the judges are rating yes/no (for example, is there a pet), you could report the rating given by the majority of the judges.\n",

      <h2>Options</h2>
      <p>In addition to the<code>q</code>parameter, Feedr supports other optional parameters.</p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>callback</td>
            <td>Wraps the answer in a function call, which makes it compatible to JSONP calls</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>In order to run the app locally, you can execute the following steps:</p>
      <code>
        git clone git@github.com:sdepold/feedrapp.git
        cd feedrapp
        yarn
        yarn start
      </code>
      <p>The app will now start on port 8080 and can be queried like this:</p>
      <code>
        curl http://localhost:8080/?q=http://www.ebaytechblog.com/feed/
      </code>
      <p>
        The easiest way to get your own dedicated version of feedrapp is probably via Heroku:
      </p>
      <code>
        heroku create
        git push heroku master
        heroku open
      </code>

      <h2>Caching</h2>
      <p>
        Since v1.5.0 every requested RSS feed is cached for 30 minutes. This value might be configurable
        in the future. Pull requests are welcome. The change was introduced because the app received too
        much traffic to function fine on Heroku â€“ and because it just makes sense.
